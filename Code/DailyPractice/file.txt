Good morning,teachers
    I am very glad to be here for this interview，My name is Yintianhao，I am 21 years old，born in MiLuo City of Hunan Province，I will graduate from Hunan University of Science and Technology。I major in Software Engineering。
    During the past four years，I have worked very hard at my courses，so as to lay a solid foundation of theoretical knowledge，such as Data Structure，Operating System and Computer Network。Moreover，I have passed CET-4 and CET-6 with a decent scores。In order to improve my practical skills，I took part in the laboratory of 
my school to learn Android Developing and Java Web Developing and took part in many program-developing contests with my partner，some of which ended up with a prize。In my daily life，I always enjoy reading and write the knowledge I leaned in my blog。
    If I have the honor to pursue the master's degree in Beijing Jiaotong University，I will spare no effort to research my major，build systematic view of mangerment and achieve self value。
    That's all,thank you.
